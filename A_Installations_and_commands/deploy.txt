4) Next go to your React App folder in the command line and run the command npm run build. This will do all the work necessary to have your app ready for deployment. (If you are not able to get routes working, sometimes its due to BrowserRouter, you can use HashRouter, this works fine when deploying to netlify)
        i) If you have react-router-dom installed, then you need to do an additional step of setting redirects on netlify
       ii) In your build folder, create _redirects file.
      iii) Add the following to the _redirects file (/* /index.html 200)

5) Now type netlify deploy and visit the link it provides to verify your account.
